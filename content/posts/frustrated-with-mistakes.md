While I was practicing dancing last night, I was frustrated with making basic mistakes. The continuous swing movement from beat 2 to 3 in Waltz, body moving forward while stepping forward. These are basics, but I was not doing it well. This frustrates me, as I was thinking an advanced dancers should not be making such mistakes.

If I allowed frustration to take over me, I wouldn't be able to practice effectively and also waste my partner's time.

It is okay to make mistakes. Human is not perfect, even professionals with years of experience also make mistakes. 

Being able to spot mistakes and correcting is a **small win**. It leads to improvements, which is the main purpose of dance practice.
