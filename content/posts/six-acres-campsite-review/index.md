# Impression

Similar to [Yaka Campsite]({{< ref "/posts/yaka-campsite-review" >}}), this campsite sits on a hill. There are designated slots, some on flat land and some on the slope. Some of them are under tall trees, another 2 are sheltered.

It was 2<sup>nd</sup> March 2024, campsite was fully booked. I was allocated slot #8, which is a flat land without any trees. I was unable to hang by hammock üôÅ. The soil is quite firm, so 15cm tent stakes are sufficient. The place where I camped gets really muddy under rain. Tip: *try to secure a slot with grassland and trees*.

The parking lots and campsite are separated. I am lucky to get a slot near my car.

Besides toilet area, there are also basins within the campground. Conveniently accessible and reduces queue for basin. Water comes from nature source, it seems cleaner than [Tiger Base Camp]({{< ref "/posts/tiger-base-camp-review" >}}).

There is a photo spot, overseeing the forest under the hill.

# Best Part

Campsite is clean, well-maintained. No bug/mosquito. For those camping under the trees backing the forest, I am not sure if it is also mosquito-free. Good mobile (Digi) reception.

# Kids Friendly

Kids might like the playground and swings. There is also a stream nearby.

Turn right upon reaching this signboard. When you approached an intersection choose the path on the right, which leads downhill. Driving experience might be a bit intimidating for the inexperienced, four-wheel drive is recommended. 

# Toilets
