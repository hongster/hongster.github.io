After the [competition](/posts/wilayah-open-dance-championship-2022), my teacher said that I was not using my full strength in dancing. I got defensive, and get the impression that he was assuming that I wasn't doing my best in the competition. It took me some time to realize that doing your best and being able to exert full strength are 2 different things.

You might have a good deal of strength, but without the right techniques, you will not be able to fully utilize it. This is one of the important lessons that I learned from the competition. He went on to teach us how to use ankle and thigh muscle to exert strength. When I achieving mastery on these techniques, I will be sharing it in this blog.
