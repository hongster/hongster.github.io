18 May 2024, this is my 9<sup>th</sup> camping trip. Willow Tree is a campsite located at Cherating, Kuantan, Pahang.

# Getting There

Search for "willow tree cherating" in either [Google Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P64vvFtzQVTgzpia8) or [Waze](https://www.waze.com/en/live-map/directions/my/pahang/balok/willow-tree-cherating?place=ChIJJ45huFWFyDERH3z-CgNERxQ). Neither app will lead you to the actual destination. Once the navigation app leads you to Jalan Kemaman, look out for "_Cherating Beach House Estate_" signboard and follow it.

Eventually you will reach a crossroad with many signboards, one of it is "_Willow Tree Cherating_". You will reach the campsite in a minute or two.

# Campsite

The tent pitching area is right behind the Cherating beach. You will get a nice view of the sea. The sea wave might get very loud at night, but some people find it soothing. Wind is really strong and the ground is mainly sand. Make sure to bring long tent pegs. Keep the tarp low or tie it to trees (there are not many trees there).

There is a tree with a platform on top. The tree provides good shading. I went up the platform with my air mattress and had a good nap.

There is also a common area for campers to gather. Since there are not much trees at the campsite, you can hang hammock in this place.

# Toilet

There are 2 basins at the toilet area. 4 bathrooms: 3 with shower heater, 1 open-air shower without heater. Water is clean. Toilet is also very clean and well maintained.
