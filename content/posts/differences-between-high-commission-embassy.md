*Disclaimer: Answer from Google AI Overviews*

The main difference is their relationship to the Commonwealth: an embassy is a diplomatic mission to a non-Commonwealth country, headed by an Ambassador, while a high commission is a diplomatic mission to a Commonwealth country, headed by a High Commissioner. Functionally, they perform the same role of representing their home government in the host country, but the term high commission is a legacy from the past when Commonwealth countries were not considered "foreign" to each other. 

## Embassy

- Purpose: A diplomatic mission from a country to a non-Commonwealth country. 
- Head: The head of the mission is called an Ambassador. 
- Context: Represents a sending country in a non-Commonwealth country. 
- Activities: Engages in trade, cultural exchange, defense, and immigration, among other diplomatic functions, and maintains diplomatic relations with the host country. 

## High Commission

- Purpose: A diplomatic mission from a Commonwealth country to another Commonwealth country. 
- Head: The head of the mission is called a High Commissioner. 
- Context: Represents a Commonwealth country in another Commonwealth country. 
- Activities: Nurtures foreign relations within the Commonwealth, strengthens bonds between member states, and engages in collaborative efforts to address global challenges, according to worldpassports.org. 

## In Summary

Embassy is the standard term for a diplomatic mission to a country that is not a member of the Commonwealth. High Commission is the equivalent term used between Commonwealth countries, a tradition stemming from the time when Commonwealth members did not view each other as fully foreign.
