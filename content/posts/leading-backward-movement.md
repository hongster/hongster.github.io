Sometime when I move backward, I feel that my partner is overtaking me, and I am not catching up with my partner. An example is during step 3 and 4 of Quickstep's [Quick Open Reverse](https://www.dancecentral.info/ballroom/international-style/quickstep/quick-open-reverse). Especially when it continues with more backward steps in following figure.

# Symptoms

When I am moving backward and my partner is moving forward in quick timing,

* I feel that she is accelerating faster and faster, although she is just following my lead;
* I feel that she is almost overtaking me and about to move past me.

# Cause

* I have difficulty catching up with the fast timing.
* When trying to catch up with the speed, there is tendency to slant body backward or pull body back too much.
* Follower senses pulling of my body backward, she naturally *moves faster forward* to maintain contact with my body. This might lead to vicious cycle as I further pull my body back (intending to move back faster).

# Solution

* Maintain the body in a straight and upright position, let the legs do the moving.
* Keep your body at the front, ensuring your partner do not fall forward.
* Stretch the moving leg backward while maintaining body in upright position.
