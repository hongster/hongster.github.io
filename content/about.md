**Hello world!** I am Hong, from Malaysia. This website is a playground for me to play with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/). *I code, I eat, I dance.*

**I Code.** I run a software company focusing on developing web and mobile applications. I have a wide job scope covering software consulting, technical documentation, software design, Linux server administration. From time to time I write automation scripts in PHP, Go, and Python. I am a geeky person and I write about techie stuffs on [tech.mrleong.net](https://tech.mrleong.net).

**I Eat.** Malaysia is a great place for foodies. The multiracial society and rich history (British colony) give rise to variety of food. I am using this website to keep track of the food I like. Sometime I post food photos on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hongster85/).

**I Dance.** [International Style Ballroom Dancing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ballroom_dance) (also known as Dancesport) consist of 10 dances. Cha Cha, Rumba, Samba, Jive, and Paso Doble are collectively known as Latin dances. Waltz, Quickstep, Foxtrot, Tango, and Viennese Waltz are collectively known as Standard dances. I am quite passionate about Standard dances. Through dancing I learn a lot about my body and teamwork. Sometime I write about what I learned.
